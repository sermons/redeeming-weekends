## Isaiah 58:1-2 (NIV) (p.1/10)
**Shout** it aloud, do not hold back. <br/>
Raise your **voice** like a trumpet. <br/>
Declare to my people their **rebellion** <br/>
and to the descendants of Jacob their **sins**.

For day after day they **seek me out**; <br/>
they **seem eager** to know my ways, <br/>
as if they were a nation that **does what is right** <br/>
and has not **forsaken the commands** of its God.

---

## Isaiah 58:2-3 (NIV) (p.2/10)
They ask me for **just decisions** <br/>
and seem eager for God to **come near** them.

"Why have we **fasted**," they say, <br/>
"and you have **not seen** it? <br/>
Why have we **humbled** ourselves, <br/>
and you have **not noticed**?"

---

## Isaiah 58:3-4 (NIV) (p.3/10)
Yet on the day of your fasting, <br/>
you do **as you please** <br/>
and **exploit** all your workers.

Your fasting ends in **quarreling and strife**, <br/>
and in **striking each other** with wicked fists.

You **cannot fast** as you do today <br/>
and expect your voice to be **heard on high**.

---

## Isaiah 58:5 (NIV) (p.4/10)
Is this the **kind of fast** I have chosen, <br/>
only a day for people to **humble themselves**?

Is it only for **bowing one’s head** like a reed <br/>
and for lying in **sackcloth and ashes**?

Is that what you call a fast, <br/>
a day **acceptable to the Lord**?

---

## Isaiah 58:6-7 (NIV) (p.5/10)
Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen:

to loose the **chains of injustice** <br/>
and untie the **cords of the yoke**, <br/>
to set the **oppressed** free <br/>
and **break every yoke**?

Is it not to **share your food** with the hungry <br/>
and to provide the poor wanderer with **shelter** — <br/>
when you see the naked, to **clothe them**, <br/>
and not to turn away from your own **flesh and blood**?

---

## Isaiah 58:8-9 (NIV) (p.6/10)
Then your **light** will break forth like the dawn, <br/>
and your **healing** will quickly appear;

then your righteousness will **go before** you, <br/>
and the glory of the Lord will be your **rear guard**.

Then you will **call**, and the Lord will **answer**; <br/>
you will **cry for help**, and he will say: **Here am I**.

---

## Isaiah 58:9-10 (NIV) (p.7/10)
“If you do away with the **yoke of oppression**, <br/>
with the **pointing finger** and **malicious talk**,

and if you **spend yourselves** in behalf of the hungry <br/>
and **satisfy the needs** of the oppressed,

then your light will rise in the **darkness**, <br/>
and your **night** will become like the noonday.

---

## Isaiah 58:11-12 (NIV) (p.8/10)
The Lord will **guide** you always; <br/>
he will **satisfy your needs** in a sun-scorched land <br/>
and will **strengthen** your frame.

You will be like a **well-watered garden**, <br/>
like a **spring** whose waters never fail.

Your people will **rebuild** the ancient ruins <br/>
and will **raise up** the age-old foundations;

you will be called **Repairer** of Broken Walls, <br/>
**Restorer** of Streets with Dwellings.

---

## Isaiah 58:12-13 (NIV) (p.9/10)
“If you keep your feet from breaking the **Sabbath** <br/>
and from doing **as you please** on my holy day,

if you call the Sabbath a **delight** <br/>
and the Lord’s holy day **honorable**,

and if you honor it by not going your **own way** <br/>
and not doing **as you please** or speaking **idle** words,

---

## Isaiah 58:14 (NIV) (p.10/10)
Then you will **find your joy** in the Lord,

and I will cause you to **ride in triumph** <br/>
on the heights of the land

and to **feast on the inheritance** <br/>
of your father Jacob.

The mouth of the Lord has spoken.
